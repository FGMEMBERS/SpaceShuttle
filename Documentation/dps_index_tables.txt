Avionics index tables
=====================

The Shuttle DPS accepts settings of several important items by index, for instance the landing site is chosen by entering a number.

In reality, these numbers are i-loaded for a specific mission, in FG they are hard coded. In the following is a list of all the items that are accessible via indices.

Landing, TAL and contingency sites
==================================

Landing sites are chosen in SPEC 50 as ITEM 41. There are regular landing sites, TAL sites, contingency abort landing and emergency landing sites available.


Currently implemented are

Index	Name				status
-----	----				------
 1 	Kennedy Space Center 	 	regular 
 2 	Vandenberg Air Force Base 	regular 
 3 	Edwards Air Force Base 	 	regular 
 4 	White Sands Space Harbor 	regular, lakebed landing 
 5 	Zaragoza Airbase 	 	TAL
 6 	RAF Fairford 	 		TAL
 7 	Banjul International Airport 	TAL
 8 	Moron Airbase			TAL
 9	Le Tube				TAL
10	(Ben Guerir)			(TAL, does not exist in FG scenery)
11	Bermuda				abort landing site
12	Halifax				east coast abort landing site
13	Wilmington			east coast abort landing site
14	Atlantic City			east coast abort landing site
15 	Myrtle Beach			east coast abort landing site
16	Gander				east coast abort landing site
17	Pease				east coast abort landing site
18 	Oceana Naval Air Station	east coast abort landing site
30 	Easter Island			TAL for Vandenberg launches, never used in reality
32	Diego Garcia			emergency landing site
33	Honolulu Intl. Airport		emergency landing site
34	Keflavik Intl. Airport		emergency landing site
35	Andersen Air Force Base	Guam	emergency landing site	
36	Amilcar Cabral Intl. Airport	emergency landing site
37 	Ascension Island RAF		emergency landing site
38	Wake Island			emergency landing site
39	Lajes Air Base			emergency landing site

Stars available for COAS
========================

The COAS procedure requires to enter a star index by hand and identify the corresponding star visibly by alignig the Shuttle (you need to be able to visually identify the star using a star chart or in the sky to do a COAS).

The star ID is entered in SPEC 22 as ITEM 21.

Index 	 star
-----	 ---- 
 11 	 Shedir 
 12 	 Mirphak 
 13 	 Mizar 
 14 	 Arcturus 
 15 	 Betelgeuse 
 16 	 Procyon 
 17 	 Spica
 18	 Antares
 19	 Canopus
 20	 Sirius

Abort burn targets
==================

For an ATO or AOA abort, burn targets for the OMS can be called up in OPS 104 and OPS 105 via ITEM 35 via a target index.

The corresponding burn targets (see the crew manual section 6 for details) are

Index 	 target
-----	 -----
 1	 OMS-1 burn to raise apoapsis to a safe value
 3	 ATO OMS-2 burn to circularize orbit
 4	 AOA OMS-2 de-orbit burn for a nominal entry trajectory
 5	 AOA OMS-2 de-orbit burn for a shallow entry trajectory
