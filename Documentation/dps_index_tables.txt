Avionics index tables
=====================

The Shuttle DPS accepts settings of several important items by index, for instance the landing site is chosen by entering a number.

In reality, these numbers are i-loaded for a specific mission, in FG they are hard coded. In the following is a list of all the items that are accessible via indices.

Landing, TAL and contingency sites
==================================

Landing sites are chosen in SPEC 50 as ITEM 41. There are regular landing sites, TAL sites and contingency landing sites available.


Currently implemented are

Index	Name				status
-----	----				------
 1 	Kennedy Space Center 	 	regular 
 2 	Vandenberg Air Force Base 	regular 
 3 	Edwards Air Force Base 	 	regular 
 4 	White Sands Space Harbor 	regular, lakebed landing 
 5 	Zaragoza Airbase 	 	TAL
 6 	RAF Fairford 	 		TAL, currently no TAEM guidance 
 7 	Banjul International Airport 	TAL


Stars available for COAS
========================

The COAS procedure requires to enter a star index by hand and identify the corresponding star visibly by alignig the Shuttle (you need to be able to visually identify the star using a star chart or in the sky to do a COAS).

The star ID is entered in SPEC 22 as ITEM 21.

Index 	 star
-----	 ---- 
 11 	 Shedir 
 12 	 Mirphak 
 13 	 Mizar 
 14 	 Arcturus 
 15 	 Betelgeuse 
 16 	 Procyon 
 17 	 Spica

Abort burn targets
==================

For an ATO or AOA abort, burn targets for the OMS can be called up in OPS 104 and OPS 105 via ITEM 35 via a target index.

The corresponding burn targets (see the crew manual section 6 for details) are

Index 	 target
-----	 -----
 1	 OMS-1 burn to raise apoapsis to a safe value
 3	 ATO OMS-2 burn to circularize orbit
 4	 AOA OMS-2 de-orbit burn for a nominal entry trajectory
 5	 AOA OMS-2 de-orbit burn for a shallow entry trajectory
