Spartan-201

Satalite model courtesy NASA 3D Resources, deployed and retrieved on multiple
Space Shuttle missions:

	Spartan-201-1 on STS-56 (1993 April)
	Spartan-201-2 on STS-64 (1994 September)
	Spartan-201-3 on STS-69 (1995 April)
	Spartan-201-4 on STS-87

Mission video can be gathered on youtube as well as google search.

RMS attach point start:

	X: -0.00572
	Y: -0.00221
	Z: +0.76865

RMS attach point end:

	X: -0.00571
	Y: -0.00221
	Z: +0.63228

	The center tip of the RMS grapple should slide in a straight line
	from the Start to End of the two attach points listed above. There
	are 12 thrusters located on the SPARTAAN-201 and are angled at 15
	degrees in the various direction they protrude from in the model.

	There seems to be no moving parts visible from what I have found
	so far.

	* Removed 5,916 vertices by using "Remove Doubles"
	* Exported to .ac format for FlightGear.org
	* Added an edge loop to the attach point to find the proper stop
	  area of attachment.
	* Created this readme.
	* Created "Preview.png"

TODO:
	* A payload carrier needs to be created, see videos for referance
          and placement location within the shuttle.
	* A metalic gold texture should be applied to all gold colored areas
	* Figure out the naming of each thruster.
	* Find location and direction of each thruster.
	* Smooth rounded edges prior to adding any textures.
	* Convert triangles to quads, push for 0 triangles.
